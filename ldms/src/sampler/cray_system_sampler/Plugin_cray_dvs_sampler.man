.SH NAME
Plugin_cray_dvs_sampler - man page for the LDMS cray_dvs_sampler plugin

.SH SYNOPSIS
Within ldmsd_controller or a configuration file:
.br
config name=cray_dvs_sampler [ <attr>=<value> ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
With LDMS (Lightweight Distributed Metric Service), plugins for the ldmsd (ldms daemon) are configured via ldmsd_controller
or a configuration file.

The cray_dvs_sampler plugin provides memory info from /proc/fs/dvs/mount/[mount-id]/stats.
A separate metric set is produced for each mount point.
Metric set names are of the form `XXX'.

See section `DATA AND THE CONFIGURATION FILE' for information on the variables and configuration file.

This sampler is for Cray systems only.

.SH CONFIGURATION ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
The cray_dvs_sampler plugin uses the sampler_base base class. This man page covers only the configuration attributes, or those with default values, specific to the this plugin; see ldms_sampler_base.man for the attributes of the base class.

Optional schema name. It is intended that the same sampler on different nodes with different metrics have a
different schema. If not specified, will default to `cray_dvs_sampler`.

.SH DATA AND THE CONFIGURATION FILE
The data source is /proc/fs/dvs/mount/[mount-id]/stats. This file consists of a number of lines of
the format
.br
variablename: v1 v2 ... vN
.br

The number of values varies between 1 and 6. Each line will then produce between 1 and 6 metrics
with names of the form variablename appended by an additional string associated with thr interpretation
of that value (e.g, min, err).

By default, this sampler will collect all the variables for all mount points. The number of metrics can be
downselected by using a configuration file (see conffile argument). The format of this file is one variablename
per line, comments start with '#' and blank lines are skipped. Note that the variablename from the dataline
is what is specified in the configuration file, not the metricnames associated with that variablename in
the data source file. As a result, all metrics associated with a give line in the dvs stats source are included
or excluded together.


.SH NOTES
.PP
.IP \[bu]
In the config, the sampler is called cray_dvs_sampler. Also the library is called libcray_dvs_sampler. However, the source file is dvs_sampler.c
.PP
.IP \[bu]
This sampler is for Cray systems only.
