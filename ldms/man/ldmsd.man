.SH NAME
ldmsd \- Start an ldms daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
ldmsd [OPTION...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The ldmsd command can be used
to start an ldms daemon. Plugin configuration of the ldmsd can be done via the
a configuration file or the ldmsd_controller.

Starting ldmsd with the configuration file option enables you to statically configure a
sampler without requiring python. Dynamically configuring samplers with ldmsd_controller requires python.
Currently, v2's ldmsctl can still be used to dynamically configure a sampler without requiring
python. This capability will be replaced and it is not recommended that you use this option.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SS
The ldmsd-check-env program will dump currently set environment variables that may influence ldmsd and plugin behavior.
The following environment variables must often be set:
.TP
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Path to ovis/lib and libevent2/lib, if not in a system default path. Depending on the system these may be lib64 instead of lib.
.TP
PATH
Include the path to sbin directory containing ldmsd.
.SS The following environment variables may be set to override compiled-in defaults:
.TP
ZAP_LIBPATH
Path to ovis/lib/ovis-ldms
.TP
LDMSD_PLUGIN_LIBPATH
Path to ovis/lib/ovis-ldms
.TP
LDMSD_PIDFILE
Full path name of pidfile overriding the default /var/run/ldmsd.pid unless the command line argument "-r pidfilepath" is present.
.TP
LDMSD_LOG_TIME_SEC
If present, log messages are stamped with the epoch time rather than the date string. This is useful when sub-second information is desired or correlating log messages with other epoch-stamped data.
.TP
LDMSD_SOCKPATH
Path to the unix domain socket for the ldmsd. Default is created within /var/run. If you must change the default (e.g., not running as root and hence /var/run is not writeable), set this variable (e.g., /tmp/run/ldmsd) or specify "-S socketpath" to ldmsd.
.TP
LDMSD_MEM_SZ
The size of memory reserved for metric sets. Set this variable or specify "-m"
to ldmsd. See the -m option for further details. If both are specified, the -m
option takes precedence over this environment variable.
.TP
LDMSD_UPDTR_OFFSET_INCR
The increment to the offset hint in microseconds. This is only for updaters that
determine the update interval and offset automatically. For example, the offset
hint is 100000 which is 100 millisecond of the second.  The updater offset will
be 100000 + LDMSD_UPDTR_OFFSET_INCR. The default is 100000 (100 milliseconds).
.SS CRAY Specific Environment variables for ugni transport
ZAP_UGNI_PTAG
For XE/XK, the PTag value as given by apstat -P.
For XC, The value does not matter but the environment variable must be set.
.TP
ZAP_UGNI_COOKIE
For XE/XK, the Cookie value corresponding to the PTag value as given by apstat -P
For XC, the Cookie value (not Cookie2) as given by apstat -P
.TP
ZAP_UGNI_CQ_DEPTH
Optional value for the CQ depth. Default is 2048.
.TP
ZAP_UGNI_STATE_INTERVAL
Optional. If set, then ldmsd will check all nodes' states via rca interface.
States for all nodes are checked and stored at intervals determined by this environment variable. The stored
values are checked against before contacting a node. If you choose to use this option, then the rule of
thumb is to set ZAP_UGNI_STATE_INTERVAL and ZAP_UGNI_STATE_OFFSET such that the node states are checked
before the metric set update occurs (see interval and offset in ldmsd_controller)
.TP
ZAP_UGNI_STATE_OFFSET
Optional. Only relevant if ZAP_UGNI_STATE_INTERVAL is set. Defaults to zero. Offset from zero for
checking the nodes state (see ZAP_UGNI_STATE_INTERVAL, above).


.SH OPTIONS
.SS
General/Configuration Options:
.TP
.BR -F
Run in foreground mode; don't daemonize the program. Default is false.
.TP
.BI "-B, --banner" " version-file-mode [0, 1, 2]"
When run in daemon mode, controls the existence of the banner file.
Mode 0 suppresses the version file. Mode 1 deletes it at daemon exit. Mode >= 2 leaves it in place for debugging after daemon exit. Default mode is 1.
The banner contains the software and protocol versions information, which is also logged at the INFO level. The banner file name is always the pidfile name with .version appended.
.TP
.BI "-c " CONFIG_PATH
The path to configuration file (optional, default: <none>). The configuration
file contains a batch of ldmsd controlling commands, such as `load` for loading
a plugin, and `prdcr_add` for defining a ldmsd producer to aggregate from (see
\fBldmsd_controller\fR(8) for a complete list of commands, or simply run
\fBldmsd_controller\fR then \fBhelp\fR). The commands in the configuration file
are executed sequentially, except for \fBprdcr_start\fR, \fBupdtr_start\fR,
\fBstrgp_start\fR, and \fBfailover_start\fR that will be deferred. If
\fBfailover_start\fR is present, the failover service will start first (among
the deferred). Then, upon failover pairing success or failure, the other
deferred configuration objects will be started. Please also note that while
failover service is in use, prdcr, updtr, and strgp cannot be altered (start,
stop, or reconfigure) over in-band configuration. See also REORDERED COMMANDS below.
.TP
.BI "-m, --set_memory" " MEMORY_SIZE"
.br
MEMORY_SIZE is the maximum size of pre-allocated memory for metric sets.
The given size must be less than 1 petabytes.
For example, 20M or 20mb are 20 megabytes. The default is adequate for most ldmsd acting in the collector role.
For aggregating ldmsd, a rough estimate of preallocated memory needed is (Number of nodes aggregated) x (Number of metric sets per node) x 4k.
Data sets containing arrays may require more. The estimate can be checked by enabling DEBUG logging and examining the mm_stat bytes_used+holes value at ldmsd exit.
.TP
.BI "-n, --daemon_name" " NAME"
.br
The name of the daemon. By default, it is "\fIHOSTNAME:PORT\fR". The failover feature uses the daemon name to verify the buddy name, and the producer name of kernel metric sets is the daemon name.
.TP
.BI "-r, --pid_file" " pid_file"
The path to the pid file and prefix of the .version banner file for daemon mode.
.TP
.BR -V
Display LDMS version information and then exit.
.TP
.BR -u " plugin_name"
Display the usage for named plugin. Special names all, sampler, and store match all, sampler type, and store type plugins, respectively.


.SS
Communication Options:
.TP
.BI -x " XPRT:PORT:HOST"
.br
Specifies the transport type to listen on. May be specified more than once for
multiple transports. The XPRT string is one of 'rdma', 'sock', or 'ugni' (CRAY
XE/XK/XC). A transport specific port number must be specified following a \':',
e.g. rdma:10000. An optional host or address may be specified after the port,
e.g. rdma:10000:node1-ib, to listen to a specific address.

The listening transports can also be specified in the configuration file using
\fBlisten\fR command, e.g. `listen xprt=sock port=1234 host=node1-ib`. Please see
\fBldmsd_controller\fR(8) section \fBLISTEN COMMAND SYNTAX\fR for more details.
.TP
.BI "-a, --default_auth" " AUTH"
Specify the default LDMS Authentication method for the LDMS connections in this
daemon (when the connections do not specify authentication method/domain).
Please see \fBldms_authentication\fR(7) for more information. If this option is
not given, the default is "none" (no authentication). Also see
\fBldmsd_controller\fR(8) section \fBAUTHENTICATION COMMAND SYNTAX\fR for how to
define an authentication domain.
.TP
.BI "-A, --default_auth_args" " NAME" = VALUE
Passing the \fINAME\fR=\fIVALUE\fR option to the LDMS Authentication plugin.
This command line option can be given multiple times. Please see
\fBldms_authentication\fR(7) for more information, and consult the plugin manual
page for plugin-specific options.
.TP
.BI "-C, --credits" " BYTES"
The daemon's advertised send credits (default: -1, unlimited). This number
limits how much data our daemon holds for each peer. The peers drop messages
when they don't have enough send credits. The specified credits apply to both
passive connections (other processes connect to us) and active connections (we
connect to other processes by 'prdcr_add' command). The active connections can
override the credits value by specifying the \fIcredits\fR attribute to
\fBpdrcr_add\fR command (see \fBldmsd_controller\fR(8)).


.SS
Log Verbosity Options:
.TP
.BI "-l, --log_file" " LOGFILE"
.br
LOGFILE is the path to the log file for status messages. Default is stdout unless given.
The syslog facility is used if LOGFILE is exactly "syslog".
Silence can be obtained by specifying /dev/null for the log file or using command line redirection as illustrated below.
.TP
.BI "-v, --log_level" " LOG_LEVEL"
.br
LOG_LEVEL can be one of DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, CRITICAL or QUIET.
The default level is ERROR. QUIET produces only user-requested output.
(Note: this has changed from the previous release where q designated no (QUIET) logging).
.TP
.BR -t
Truncate the log file if it already exists.
.TP
.BI -L, --log_config " <CINT:PATH> | <CINT> | <PATH>"
.br
Append configuration replay messages or configuration debugging messages to the log indicated by -l (when PATH is omitted) or to the file named PATH. Bit values of CINT correspond to:
.nf
      0: no messages
      1: debug messages from the generic 'request' handler
      2: config history messages in replayable format
      4: query history messages in replayable format
      8: failover debugging messages
     16: include delta time prefix when using PATH
     32: include epoch timestamp prefix when using PATH
.fi
These values may be added together to enable multiple outputs. All messages are logged at the user-requested level, LDMSD_LALL. CINT values 2, 26 and 27 are often interesting. When CINT is omitted, 1 is the default. When PATH is used, the log messages are flushed to as they are generated.

.SS
Kernel Metric Options:
.TP
.BR "-k, --publish_kernel"
Publish kernel metrics.
.TP
.BI "-s, --kernel_set_file" " SETFILE"
Text file containing kernel metric sets to publish. Default: /proc/sys/kldms/set_list

.SS Thread Options:
.TP
.BI "-P, --worker_threads" " THR_COUNT"
.br
THR_COUNT is the number of event threads to start.

.SH SPECIFYING COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS IN CONFIGURATION FILES
