# Set up to make relocatables (everything must have common prefix)
~/.rpmmacros should contain:
%_prefix /opt/ovis
%_infodir %{_prefix}/share/info
%_mandir %{_prefix}/share/man
%_defaultdocdir %{_prefix}/share/doc

And you need a matching Prefix: directive in the spec file.

If you want to start from an existing fedora source RPM,
load in the original srpm from fedora repo:
	rpm -ivh $srpmname
This will go to the root rpmbuild tree if you have not set up
~/.rpmmacros and ~/rpmbuild first.

Building the rpms goes something like the contents of the pack-*sh scripts,
but note you may have to set up your own ~/rpmbuild tree first and download
the right source tar file.
