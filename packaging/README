PURPOSE:

This directory is primarily for maintainers of OVIS tools,
not for beginning developers. As such, good scripting
skills are needed to understand most of the files herein.

Do NOT expect to be able to run any script in here in random environments.

A few scripts (make-all-*) are provided demonstrating manual builds
with various configuration options on recent platforms. With these
scripts, *** YOUR Mileage May Vary***
Don't hesitate to contact ovis-help@sandia.gov if you are having build problems.
The wiki at ovis.ca.sandia.gov also has some build documentation.

The construction of rpms has moved elsewhere. One such place (for TOSS linux)
is github.com/baallan/distribution
